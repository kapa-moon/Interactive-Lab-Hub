## Planning

#### "Reminder Box"

When we go out, especially when we on a tight schdule, it's not rare that we sometimes JUST forgot the very essential items that we, intuitively, should have thought of bringing, even it's right there, next to the door...

So, what if there's a voice, when you go out, remind you if you have forgot something.

#### Limitations
- One of the solutions that worked for the target function is that the distance sensor can tell, within the assigned range of distance, if there's an object. This is not ideal because the user 1) don't get to set what they want to put and 2) it almost only works for one item.
- The items that can be put in the Reminder Box is pre-defined.
- Users should be able to define the items that they want to put in the box.

- Updates: the setting process, where the user can decide what to put on each spot
